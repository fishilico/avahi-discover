This project is an improvement of the Python avahi-discover program available
at http://git.0pointer.de/?p=avahi.git;a=tree;f=avahi-python/avahi-discover

It adds:
 * Subdomain browsing (with Avahi's DomainBrowserNew)
 * TreeView is now presented on domain/service type/service, no longer interface
   or "Wide Area" items.
 * .local domains folds automatically if other domains are available, to give a
   clearer view.
